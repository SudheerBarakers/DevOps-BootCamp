: <<'EOF'
For ease of use, executing this script has to be done using a customized command by declaring it in .bash_aliases .
nano ~/.bash_aliases 
this command can be used to edit the bash_aliases file, and add the following line in it and save it.
alias gitbot='source path';
you have to change the path to the location of this shell script on your PC.
So, Whenever you type gitbot in your terminal this script will run thus automating the git push process.
For detailed explanation of the project, you can refer my medium article on git automation.
