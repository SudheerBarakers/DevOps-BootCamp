Let's discuss the fundamentals of python.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, https://www.python.org/, and may be freely distributed.

What python is used for?
Web Development.
Data Science.
Machine Learning.
Artificial Intelligence.
Automation with DevOps.
Automate general tasks.
Python Installation.
To install python3, just type the following command in the terminal and it will be installed automatically.

1) Update the APT Repository
$ apt-get update.

2) Install Python
$ apt-get install python3.6

3) Verify Python
When we type python, it shows default installed python that is 2.7.

For Python3 type the following command, then it will show the other version as well.

$ python3

Python Data Types
1.Numeric Data type
In Python, numeric data type is used to hold numeric values.

Integers, floating-point numbers and complex numbers fall under number category.

int - holds signed integers of non-limited length. Ex: num1=3
float - holds floating decimal points and it's accurate up to 15 decimal places. Ex: num2=2.3
complex - holds complex numbers. Ex: num3=2+3j
We can use the type() function to know which class a variable or a value belongs to.

2. List Data Type
List is an ordered collection of similar or different types of items separated by commas and enclosed within brackets [].

# Basic List Operations
Create a list.
Access items of the link.
Add item to the list.
Remove the item from list.
Change items in the list.
For example,

my_list = [“April”, “May”, “June”]

print(my_list[1])

my_list.append(“Apple”

my_list.remove(“May”)

3. String Data Type
String is a sequence of characters represented by either single or double quotes. For example,

name = “DevOps” print(name)

message = ‘Welcome to DevOps’ print(message)

4. Set Data Type
Set is an unordered collection of unique items. Set is defined by values separated by commas inside braces {}. For example,

emp_id = {123, 124, 231} print(emp_id)

set does not allow duplicate values.

5. Dictionary Data Type
Python dictionary is an ordered collection of items. It stores elements in key/value pairs.

Here, keys are unique identifiers that are associated with each value.

Let’s see an example,

dict = {1: “first name”, 2: “last name”, “age”:33}
