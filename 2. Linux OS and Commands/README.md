## What is /Dev/Null in Linux?

# What is /dev?

- /dev is a directory that stores all the physical and virtual devices of a Linux system.
- A Linux system also has virtual devices which act as a device but represent no physical device.


# What is /dev/null?

- It is a virtual device, which has a special property: Any data written to /dev/null vanishes or disappears.
      Ex:
      echo " Hello Welcome" > /dev/null
      cat /dev/null
      
 - It is mainly used to discard standard output and standard error from an output.
 
 # What are standard output and standard error?
  
  The output of a Linux command contains two streams of data: standard output (stdout) and standard error (stderr0), 
  while the standard output is the normal output if the command has no errors, the standard error is the error generated by the command.
